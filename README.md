## Pull Request Guidelines

Put the name of the exercise in the subject line of the commit. E.g. hamming: Add test case for strands of unequal length

The subject line should be a one-sentence summary.

Any extra detail should be provided in the body of the pull request.

Don't submit unrelated changes in the same pull request.

If you end up with a lot of small commits that really make up one change, squash your commits. Refer to the guidelines on [squashing commits](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing/git-basics.md#commit-messages).

If you had to refactor in order to add your change, then please put two commits: First the refactoring, then the added behavior. It's fine to put this in the same pull request, unless the refactoring is huge and would make it hard to review both at the same time.

Once you've submitted a pull request, one or more of the QA team members will review it.
