## Step 1\. Open a Pull Request

`master`, you can open a _pull request_.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a _pull request_, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show _diffs_, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub’s [@mention system](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/#text-formatting-toolbar) in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.

## Step 2\. Merge your Pull Request

In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your `readme-edits` branch into the `master` branch.

1.  Click the green **Merge pull request** button to merge the changes into `master`.
2.  Click **Confirm merge**.
3.  Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the **Delete branch** button in the purple box.
